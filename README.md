## Design Philosophy

Writer Buddy embraces a minimal, literary aesthetic:
- Serif fonts (Crimson Text, EB Garamond)
- Cream background, muted colors
- No rounded corners or heavy shadows
- Generous whitespace
- Simple, understated interactions

Inspired by the personal web and sites like [simonsarris.com](https://simonsarris.com/).

## Writing Rules

Writer Buddy includes 37 preset rules based on classic writing advice:

**Word Removal**
- Qualifiers: very, really, just, quite, rather, literally, actually, etc.
- Weak words: that, then, start/begin, suddenly
- Redundant: completely, totally, extremely

**Style Checks**
- Passive voice detection
- -ly adverbs
- Repeated words
- Long sentences (30+ words)
- Vague language: thing/something, interesting, nice

**Clich√©s**
- "in order to" ‚Üí use "to"
- "there is/are" ‚Üí rewrite stronger
- "it is/was" ‚Üí rewrite stronger
